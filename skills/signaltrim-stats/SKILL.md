This skill is delivered by `hooks/signaltrim-stats.js` (read by `hooks/signaltrim-mode-tracker.js` on `/signaltrim-stats`). The model does not need to do anything when this skill fires — the hook returns `decision: "block"` with the formatted stats as the reason. The user sees the numbers immediately.
